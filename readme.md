# Election Bot
## A Public Information Campaign
### Overview
*Election Bot* exists as a static website and a social media tool intended to
inform people about the characteristics of social media posts and fake news
perpetuated by foreign governments or organizations.

The website will provide examples and guidance on how to adjust privacy settings
and evaluate / flag inappropriate content to the respective social network's
content moderation team.

It will also educate users on how to use the social media tools to evaluate
the likelihood a particular post is robotically generated or amplified.

Plain language will be used throughout the single-page website which makes
visitors feel welcome, safe with a sincere and serious, yet non-judgmental tone.

### Website

### Bot
The bot will connect to [BotOMeter](https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/#!/), a
collaborative project between IU and USC.

### Partnerships
We will look to partner with commonly used social media platforms including:
- Twitter
- Facebook / Instagram
- Pinterest

Partnerships will give credibility to the project as well as potential technical
support, insight, and amplification to their respective users.

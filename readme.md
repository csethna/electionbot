# Election Bot
## A Public Information Campaign
### Overview
*Election Bot* exists as a static website and a social media tool intended to
inform people about the characteristics of computer-generated social media posts
and fake news perpetuated by foreign governments or organizations.

### Website
The website will provide examples and guidance on how to evaluate, identify, and
flag inappropriate content to the respective social network's content moderation
team.

It will also educate users on how to use the social media tools to evaluate
the likelihood a particular post is robotically generated or amplified.

Plain language will be used throughout the single-page website which makes
visitors feel welcome, safe with a sincere and serious, yet non-judgmental tone.

### Bot
- Users will `@mention` the bot on a post they wish to check for human authenticity.

The bot will connect to [BotOMeter](https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/#!/), a
collaborative project between IU and USC.

### Partnerships
We will look to partner with commonly used social media platforms including:
- Twitter
- Facebook / Instagram
- Pinterest

Partnerships will give credibility to the project as well as potential technical
support, insight, and amplification to their respective users.
